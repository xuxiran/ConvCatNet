# ConvCatNet
Attention: all the code would be released after the publication of paper about "EEG_envelope_reconstruction".
This is because we used similiar model in this two tasks.

This will be the code to implement the ConvCatNet, which is a deep convolutional neural network to reconstruct mel spectogram from the EEG. We reach the first place in the Task 2 of Auditory EEG Challenge - ICASSP 2024.
